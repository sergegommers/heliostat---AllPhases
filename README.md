# heliostat---AllPhases

## Description

This repository contains the code for creating a Heliostat using the .NET nanoFramework.
A Heliostat is a device that reflects the sun to a fixed position, for instance, a window in your house.
The code is written using the .NET nanoFramework, and runs on a microcontroller like the ESP32.
The repository contains all steps\phases of building a Heliostat.

Details are provided on my blog at [https://www.devdotblog.com](https://www.devdotblog.com/).

To run the code you need Visual Studio and the .NET nanoFramework extension. How to setup everything is described [here](https://www.devdotblog.com/posts/2022/2022-07-01-heliostat-phase1-preparations).
